# Physical Examination Training System - User Guide

## Overview
This web application is designed for medical training with a physical examination manikin. It has two main user roles: **Examiner** and **Examinee**.

---

## üéØ How It Works

### **Examiner Role** (Instructor/Teacher)
The examiner sets up the examination scenario by configuring what sounds the manikin should produce.

#### Steps:
1. Select **"Examiner"** role from the home screen
2. Connect to the manikin via **WiFi** or **Bluetooth**
3. Configure **Respiratory Sounds** for different lung areas:
   - Lung Apex, Middle, Base, and Posterior
   - Options: Normal, Wheezing, Crackles, Rhonchi, Stridor, Diminished, Absent
4. Configure **Cardiac Sounds** for heart auscultation points:
   - Aortic, Pulmonic, Tricuspid, and Mitral areas
   - Options: Normal S1-S2, Murmurs, Gallops, Stenosis, Regurgitation, etc.
5. Click **"Apply All Settings to Manikin"** to send the configuration
6. The manikin will now produce the configured sounds when examined

---

### **Examinee Role** (Student/Trainee)
The examinee listens to the manikin and identifies the sounds at each examination point.

#### Steps:
1. Select **"Examinee"** role from the home screen
2. **Register** with:
   - Full Name
   - Staff ID
3. Click **"Start Examination"**
4. Connect to the manikin via **WiFi** or **Bluetooth**
5. For each body location, select the sound you hear from the dropdown:
   - **8 Respiratory locations** (right/left apex, middle, base, posterior upper/lower)
   - **4 Cardiac locations** (aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, mitral)
6. Click **"Submit Examination"** when complete
7. View your **detailed score report**

## üìä Scoring System

### Automatic Grading
The system automatically compares the examinee's answers with the examiner's configured sounds.

### Score Display Includes:
- **Overall Percentage**: Total correct answers out of all questions
- **Respiratory Score**: Correct respiratory answers (out of 8)
- **Cardiac Score**: Correct cardiac answers (out of 4)

### Detailed Review
After submission, examinees receive:
- ‚úÖ **Correct answers** highlighted in green
- ‚ùå **Incorrect answers** highlighted in red with the correct answer shown
- Location-by-location breakdown for both systems
- Option to print results for records

## üîÑ Workflow Example

### Scenario: Testing a student on pneumonia sounds

1. **Examiner sets up:**
   - Right Base: Crackles
   - Right Middle: Diminished
   - All other lung areas: Normal
   - All cardiac areas: Normal

2. **Examinee examines the manikin:**
   - Listens at each point
   - Selects sounds from dropdowns
   - Submits examination

3. **System calculates:**
   - Compares student answers to examiner settings
   - If student correctly identified:
     - Crackles at right base ‚úì
     - Diminished at right middle ‚úì
     - Normal everywhere else ‚úì
   - Score: 100% (12/12 correct)
